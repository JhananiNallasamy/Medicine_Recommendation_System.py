# Medicine Recommendation System Documentation

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview
This project is a Medicine Recommendation System that predicts diseases based on user-provided symptoms and provides relevant information such as disease description, precautions, medications, diets, and workouts. It leverages machine learning models for prediction and includes extensive data processing and management.

### 1.2. Objectives
- Predict the disease based on input symptoms.
- Provide detailed information on the predicted disease, including description, precautions, medications, diets, and workouts.

### 1.3. Scope
This system aims to aid users by providing initial guidance on potential diseases based on symptoms. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

## 2. Existing System
The existing system for medical diagnosis and treatment recommendations primarily relies on healthcare professionals, such as doctors and specialists. The process involves:

1. **Patient Consultation**: Patients visit healthcare providers to describe their symptoms.
2. **Medical Examination**: Doctors perform physical examinations and recommend diagnostic tests (e.g., blood tests, imaging).
3. **Diagnosis**: Based on the examination and test results, doctors diagnose the illness.
4. **Treatment Plan**: Doctors prescribe medications, recommend lifestyle changes, and suggest follow-up visits.

**Limitations of the Existing System:**
- **Accessibility**: Limited access to healthcare professionals in remote or underserved areas.
- **Time-Consuming**: Long wait times for appointments and test results.
- **Cost**: High medical expenses for consultations, tests, and treatments.
- **Human Error**: Possibility of misdiagnosis due to human error.

## 3. Proposed System
The proposed system is a Medicine Recommendation System using machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on symptoms and recommend appropriate treatments. The system includes:

1. **Data Collection**: A dataset comprising symptoms, diagnoses, and recommended treatments.
2. **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and encoding to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
3. **Model Training**: Training multiple machine learning models (SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, MultinomialNB) to predict diseases based on symptoms.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the accuracy and performance of the models.
5. **Disease Prediction**: Accepting user-input symptoms and predicting the disease.
6. **Treatment Recommendation**: Providing descriptions, precautions, medications, diets, and workouts based on the predicted disease.

**Proposed Workflow:**
- **Input Symptoms**: Users input their symptoms.
- **Prediction**: The system predicts the disease using the trained SVC model.
- **Output**: The system provides the disease description, precautions, medications, diets, and workout recommendations.

## 4. Benefits of the Proposed System
1. **Accessibility**: Provides healthcare recommendations to users in remote and underserved areas without needing a physical doctor visit.
2. **Efficiency**: Offers instant predictions and recommendations, reducing the time required for diagnosis and treatment planning.
3. **Cost-Effective**: Reduces the cost associated with multiple consultations and diagnostic tests.
4. **Consistency**: Delivers consistent recommendations based on data-driven models, minimizing human error.
5. **Educational Tool**: Helps users understand potential diseases and preventive measures, promoting better health awareness.

## 5. Target Audience
The target audience for the proposed Medicine Recommendation System includes:

1. **Patients in Remote Areas**: Individuals who have limited access to healthcare facilities.
2. **Busy Individuals**: People who seek quick and convenient medical advice without waiting for appointments.
3. **Healthcare Providers**: Doctors and nurses can use the system as a supplementary tool for diagnosis and treatment planning.
4. **Health Enthusiasts**: Individuals interested in understanding symptoms and preventive measures for various diseases.
5. **Elderly and Disabled**: Those who face challenges visiting healthcare facilities frequently.

## 6. Data

### 6.1. Datasets
The following datasets are used:
- **Training Dataset**: Contains symptoms and corresponding diseases.
- **Symptoms Dataset**: Provides descriptions for symptoms.
- **Precautions Dataset**: Lists precautions for each disease.
- **Workouts Dataset**: Suggests workouts based on diseases.
- **Description Dataset**: Contains descriptions of diseases.
- **Medications Dataset**: Lists medications for diseases.
- **Diets Dataset**: Provides dietary recommendations for diseases.

### 6.2. Data Preprocessing
The datasets were preprocessed to ensure they are suitable for model training and prediction. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing the data.

## 7. Machine Learning Models

### 7.1. Models Used
The following models were used and evaluated for disease prediction:
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes

### 7.2. Model Training and Testing
- **Data Splitting**: The data was split into training and testing sets (70% training, 30% testing).
- **Training**: Models were trained on the training set.
- **Testing**: Models were evaluated on the testing set.
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy and confusion matrix were used to evaluate the models.

### 7.3. Best Model Selection
The SVC model with a linear kernel was selected as the best model based on its performance.

## 8. Implementation

### 8.1. Model Training Code
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pickle

# Load and preprocess the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('medicine recommendation system dataset/Training.csv')
X = dataset.drop("prognosis", axis=1)
y = dataset['prognosis']

le = LabelEncoder()
le.fit(y)
Y = le.transform(y)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.3, random_state=20)

# Train the SVC model
svc = SVC(kernel='linear')
svc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the model
pickle.dump(svc, open("models/svc.pkl", "wb"))
```

### 8.2. Model Testing and Evaluation Code
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Load the saved model
svc = pickle.load(open("models/svc.pkl", 'rb'))

# Test the model
predictions = svc.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)

print(f"SVC accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(f"SVC Confusion Matrix:\n{cm}")
```

### 8.3. Prediction Function
```python
def get_predicted_value(patient_symptoms):
    input_vector = np.zeros(len(symptoms_dict))
    for item in patient_symptoms:
        if item in symptoms_dict:
            input_vector[symptoms_dict[item]] = 1
    return diseases_list[svc.predict([input_vector])[0]]
```

### 8.4. Helper Function
```python
def helper(dis):
    desc = description[description['Disease'] == dis]['Description'].values[0]
    pre = precautions[precautions['Disease'] == dis][['Precaution_1', 'Precaution_2', 'Precaution_3', 'Precaution_4']]
    pre = [col for col in pre.values.flatten()]
    med = medications[medications['Disease'] == dis]['Medication']
    med = [med for med in med.values]
    die = diets[diets['Disease'] == dis]['Diet']
    die = [die for die in die.values]
    wrkout = workout[workout['disease'] == dis]['workout']
    
    return desc, pre, med, die, wrkout
```

```python
symptoms = input("Enter your symptoms (comma-separated): ")
user_symptoms = [s.strip() for s in symptoms.split(',')]
user_symptoms = [symptom for symptom in user_symptoms if symptom in symptoms_dict]

if not user_symptoms:
    print("Invalid symptoms entered. Please try again with valid symptoms.")
else:
    try:
        predicted_disease = get_predicted_value(user_symptoms)
        desc, pre, med, die, wrkout = helper(predicted_disease)

        print("================= Predicted Disease ================")
        print(predicted_disease)
        print("================= Description ================")
        print(desc)

        for i, p_i in enumerate(pre, start=1):
            print(f"{i} : {p_i}")

        print("================= Medications ================")
        for i, m_i in enumerate(med, start=len(pre)+1):
            print(f"{i} : {m_i}")

        print("================= Workout ================")
        for i, w_i in enumerate(wrkout, start=len(pre) + len(med) + 1):
            print(f"{i} : {w_i}")

        print("================= Diets ================")
        for i, d_i in enumerate(die, start=len(pre) + len(med) + len(wrkout) + 1):
